Shrtn.ly
============
## Overview
***
At AppCorp, we recently released our new link shortner internally. But there seems to be some problems. 

**Here is how we wanted it to work.**

1. Go to the site and enter the url you want shortened
2. Shrtn gives back a shortened url and keeps a record
3. Shrtn url redirects you to original URL when used
4. Shrtn keeps track of number of times the link has been clicked

***

**But there seems to be some problems :(**

* URLS are not saving is our first problem
* We've also had issues with redirects not working

**We are hoping you can fix these issues and get Shrtn back to normal**

***

**New Functionality**

We know it's early to talk about new functionality since the app is broken, but if fixed here is what we'd like to see.

* Better stack tracking per each link click (ip address, date, browser)
* A better design (so boring right now)
